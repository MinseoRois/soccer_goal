## Online description
This is a soccer goal which can be printed without support, based on 3BoyutGaraj's. To achieve this, the angled part was also cleaned up in Blender (see attached blend file and vertex groups) so that it could be printed with that part on the bed.

Printer: FlashForge Creator Pro
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .32
Infill: rectilinear
* Layer height: .8 of nozzle width (such as .32 for .4mm nozzle)
* If using PET-G
  * Set print speeds to about half of an ABS preset and 235-240C (the example shown is HDGlass which can print at 210 C [220 first layer recommended]) with 90C bed if using bare borosilicate glass; Max speed: 40mm/s
  * If using PET-G with slic3r-git (or later stable version with the new setting), set Max volumetric speed to 5.02857 and set other settings to AUTO (otherwise supports won't hold).

## changes
(in Blender)
* rotate x -136 degrees so requires less support (new bottom is angled part as stands in use)
* on new bottom:
  * realign net (see vertex groups in blend file)
  * flatten bottom slightly to decrease overhang
